# Automatic-Irrigation-System-
An Automatic Irrigation system is quite a necessity if you have a backyard or garden. Irrigation systems offer many benefits. Not only do they help with lawn maintenance, they also help you bring down your water bill. It so happens that most property owners end up using way more water than they should, to keep the grass and the landscape looking good. This is not only a burden on their finances, but, also on the available water resources, which, to be honest, are few in number.  Irrigation systems overcome this problem by managing the watering needs of your lawn with more efficiency. Apart from uniform irrigation, these systems provide the exact amount of water your plants need. Therefore, there is almost no wastage at all. And the benefits don’t end there - irrigation systems also save time because you don’t have to manually water your lawn or garden.
